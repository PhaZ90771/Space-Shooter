# Space-Shooter
This project started as my final project for CGT 353. I worked on the game over a couple weeks. It had problems with collision detection, and just reloaded the page when you died after clicking okay on the popup with your final score. I have since then fixed most of the bugs.

The controls are: Move - arrow keys, Fire - space bar
